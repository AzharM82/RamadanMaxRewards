    titleAr: 'الصيام',
    description:
      'Fasting in Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and carries a reward that only Allah knows. Unlike other deeds whose rewards are specified, fasting is singled out by Allah as being uniquely for Him, and He alone will reward it. Every deed of the son of Adam is multiplied tenfold to seven hundred times, except fasting — it is for Allah and He rewards it without limit.',
