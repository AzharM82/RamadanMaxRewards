- **Sahih Muslim**
- **Sunan Abu Dawud** (only hadith graded Sahih)

**Strict rule**: If there is any doubt about the authenticity of a hadith (Da'if, Mawdu', or disputed), do NOT include it. Only include what is verified as Sahih or Hasan-Sahih by mainstream Sunni hadith scholars.

## APP OVERVIEW

A **Ramadan Daily Planner** that divides each day into **5 time-based sections**, showing the best deeds, prayers, adhkar, and habits a Muslim can perform to maximize reward during Ramadan. The app should also serve as a **30-day habit builder** — helping users establish routines they can carry beyond Ramadan.

Each day of Ramadan is divided into these 5 sections. Every section must display:
- The recommended deeds for that time window
- The Sahih hadith or Quran verse backing each deed
- The reward/benefit described in the source
- A checkbox or tracker so the user can mark completion
- A brief practical tip on how to perform the deed

### SECTION 1: SUHOOR (Pre-Dawn — Before Fajr Adhan)

**Time window**: Last third of the night until Fajr Adhan

**Deeds to include with their sources**:

1. **Eating Suhoor**
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 1923 — The Prophet ﷺ said: "Eat Suhoor, for in Suhoor there is blessing."
   - Source: Sahih Muslim 1095 — "The distinction between our fasting and the fasting of the People of the Book is the meal of Suhoor."
   - Reward: Barakah (blessing) and following the Sunnah; distinguishes Muslim fasting
   - Tip: Even a sip of water or a date counts as Suhoor. Delay it as close to Fajr as possible (Sahih al-Bukhari 1920 — Zaid ibn Thabit narrated there was about the time of reciting 50 ayat between their Suhoor and the Fajr prayer).

2. **Tahajjud / Qiyam al-Layl (Night Prayer before Fajr)**
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 1145 — The Prophet ﷺ said: "Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven in the last third of the night and says: 'Who is calling upon Me that I may answer him? Who is asking of Me that I may give him? Who is seeking My forgiveness that I may forgive him?'"
   - Source: Quran, Surah al-Isra 17:79 — "And from [part of] the night, pray with it as additional [worship] for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station."
   - Reward: Dua is answered; Allah descends to the lowest heaven; path to the praised station (Maqam Mahmud)
   - Tip: Even 2 rakaat before Suhoor counts. Pray Witr if not already prayed after Isha/Taraweeh.

3. **Dua at the time of Suhoor (last third of the night)**
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 6321, Sahih Muslim 758 — (same hadith about Allah descending and asking who is making dua)
   - Reward: Dua is accepted during this blessed time
   - Tip: Make a personal dua list. Include dua for yourself, parents, the Ummah, and the oppressed.

4. **Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness) at the time of Sahr (pre-dawn)**
   - Source: Quran, Surah Aal-Imran 3:17 — "...and those who seek forgiveness before dawn (bil-ashar)."
   - Reward: Allah specifically praises those who seek forgiveness at this time
   - Tip: Repeat "Astaghfirullah" and "Astaghfirullaha wa atubu ilayh" abundantly.

5. **Making the intention (Niyyah) to fast**
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 1, Sahih Muslim 1907 — "Actions are but by intentions, and every person will have only what they intended."
   - Note: The intention is in the heart, not spoken aloud. For obligatory fasts of Ramadan, the intention should be made before Fajr (based on the hadith in Sunan al-Nasa'i 2334, graded Sahih, that the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever does not intend to fast before Fajr, there is no fast for him").
   - Tip: Renew your intention every night — intend fasting for the sake of Allah alone.

   - Reward: Reward equivalent to Hajj and Umrah (if staying from Fajr to sunrise); charity for every joint in the body
   - Tip: Ishraq is prayed approximately 15–20 minutes after sunrise. Duha can be prayed any time from then until just before Dhuhr. Minimum 2 rakaat, up to 8 or 12.

   - Reward: Ten blessings from Allah for each salawat
   - Tip: Aim for at least 100 salawat daily. Say: "Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala aali Muhammad."

   - Reward: Heavy on the scales of good deeds; beloved to Allah
   - Tip: Keep your tongue moist with dhikr during all idle moments — commuting, waiting, walking.

   - Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhi 3598 (Hasan) — "Three supplications are not rejected: the dua of the fasting person until he breaks his fast, the dua of the just ruler, and the dua of the oppressed."

   - Reward: Wealth is not decreased; angels make dua for the giver; generosity is multiplied in Ramadan

### SECTION 4: IFTAR & MAGHRIB (Sunset)

**Time window**: Maghrib Adhan to Isha

**Deeds to include with their sources**:

2. **Dua at the time of breaking fast**
   - Source: Sunan Abu Dawud 2357 (graded Hasan by al-Daraqutni) — "Dhahaba al-dhama'u, wabtallatil-urooqu, wa thabata al-ajru in sha Allah" (The thirst is gone, the veins are moistened, and the reward is confirmed, if Allah wills).

   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 5017 — Reading Ayat al-Kursi before sleep: an angel guards you until morning and Shaytan does not come near.
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 6320, Sahih Muslim 2714 — "Allahumma bismika Rabbi wada'tu janbi, wa bika arfa'uhu..."

Friday (Yawm al-Jumu'ah) has unique rewards that multiply during Ramadan. The app should display these **additional deeds on every Friday**:

1. **Jumu'ah (Friday) Prayer**

   - Tip: Go as early as possible to the masjid.

2. **Reciting Surah al-Kahf**
   - Source: Sahih (al-Hakim, graded Sahih by al-Albani) — "Whoever reads Surah al-Kahf on Friday, he will be illuminated with light between the two Fridays."

   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 935, Sahih Muslim 852 — "On Friday there is an hour in which no Muslim servant stands and prays and asks Allah for something except that Allah will give it to him."
   - Most scholars say it is the last hour before Maghrib on Friday.

   - Tip: On Friday, dedicate the last hour before Maghrib entirely to dua. This combined with the dua of the fasting person before iftar makes it an extraordinarily powerful window.

5. **Ghusl (bathing) on Friday**
   - Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 877, Sahih Muslim 844 — "Ghusl on Friday is obligatory (wajib) on every adult." (Scholars interpret this as highly recommended/strongly emphasized)

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

1. **Every single hadith reference must be verified** before displaying. If in doubt, omit it.
2. **Do not include any Da'if (weak) or fabricated hadiths**. When scholars differ on grading, include only those where the majority of Sunni scholars accept it as Sahih or Hasan-Sahih.
3. **Do not include any Shia-specific practices or references**. Stick to Sunni scholarship.
4. **Do not include bid'ah (innovations in worship)**. Stick to what is authentically reported.
5. **The tone should be encouraging, not guilt-inducing**. The app should motivate users with the beauty of rewards, not frighten them with punishment.
6. **Include both men's and women's relevant guidance** where they differ (e.g., congregation, menstruation rulings regarding fasting and prayer — handle with sensitivity and scholarly accuracy).
7. **Allow users to customize** their targets (e.g., Quran pages per day, charity amount, dhikr counts).
8. **Provide transliteration and translation** for all Arabic duas and adhkar.
9. **The app should work offline** once loaded for the day (content is static per day).
10. **Allow sharing** of daily progress or motivational hadiths.
